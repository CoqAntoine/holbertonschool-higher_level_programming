Module: task_02_csv
===================

This module provides a function to convert data from a CSV file
into a JSON file named `data.json`.

It uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` and `json` modules.
Each row in the CSV file is converted into a dictionary
and then serialized as JSON.

Example:
    >>> convert_csv_to_json("data.csv")
    True
"""

import csv
import json


def convert_csv_to_json(csv_filename):
    """

        1. Open the CSV file and read its content using csv.DictReader().
        2. Convert the rows into a list of dictionaries.
        3. Serialize the list into JSON format.
        4. Write the JSON data to 'data.json'.

    Exceptions:
